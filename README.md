# Flashcards
The program emulates a set of flashcards on a screen. This is a game, which helps us to learn languages. We set a term and a definition on the card and then the program shows us the cards in random order remembering where we have done mistakes.
## How does it work
The user inputs a name of a file with their cards using the command line. After the import of the file the user can see menu:

1. ADD - add a card;
2. REMOVE - remove a card;
3. IMPORT - load cards from file;
4. EXPORT - save cards to file;
5. ASK - ask for a definition of some random cards;
6. EXIT - exit the program;
7. LOG - save the application log to the given file. Save all lines that have been input in or output to the console to the file;
8. HARDEST CARD - print the term of the card that has the most mistakes;
9. RESET STATS - erase the mistake counts for all cards.
